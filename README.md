# 3Group_RNAseq
RNAseq differential expression analysis of Aedes Agypti mosquito samples 

Input: 
raw counts data of 3 experimental groups (once of which is a control) and a relevant GTF reference genome


Output:

Raw counts, normalized counts, log-transformed counts box plots

PCA comparisons

Hierarchical clustering of global expression patterns

MA-plot of counts over log-fold change

Volcano plots comparing p-adjusted value to log-fold change

Sorted DE gene heatmaps

Text lists of DE genes sorted for input into Gene Ontology programs (external)
