# 3Group_mosquitoRNAseq
RNAseq differential expression analysis of Aedes Agypti mosquito samples 

Input: raw counts data of 3 experimental groups (once of which is a control) and a relevant GTF reference genome

Output:
\nRaw counts, normalized counts, log-transformed counts box plots
\nPCA comparisons
Hierarchical clustering of global expression patterns
MA-plot of counts over log-fold change
Volcano plots comparing p-adjusted value to log-fold change
Sorted DE gene heatmaps
Text lists of DE genes sorted for input into Gene Ontology programs (external)
